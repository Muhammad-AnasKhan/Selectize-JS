Consider a scenario where a user needs to select multiple tags for a blog post. By implementing Selectize.js, you can provide a seamless tagging experience, enabling users to search for existing tags or create new ones on-the-fly.

```html
<select id="tagsDropdown" multiple>
    <!-- Options dynamically loaded from server or defined statically -->
</select>

<script>
    $(document).ready(function () {
        $('#tagsDropdown').selectize({
            plugins: ['remove_button'],
            delimiter: ',',
            persist: false,
            create: function (input) {
                return {
                    value: input,
                    text: input
                };
            }
        });
    });
</script>
